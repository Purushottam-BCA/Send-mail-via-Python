# Send Formatted Text mail or bulk mail via Python

Python has a rich library of different functions. sending email is also one of them. I have shown 3 different ways to send mail. 
> One to One customized &amp; formatted mail (If HTML supported) & Plain text (In Case HTML Not Supported) <br>
> Send mail to many using CSV file. <br>
> Send to gmail via yagmail in just 16 lines of code.
